## Focusnet
A pytorch implementation of the paper "FocusNetv2: Imbalanced large and small organ segmentation with adversarial shape constraint for head and neck CT images" and "Focusnet: Imbalanced large and small organ segmentation with an end-to-end depp neural network for head and neck ct images"


####Training
Prepare training dataset using code in data_preprocess.


Training the S-Net using train_backbone.py

####To do
Currently only the backbone training code is released.
The training code of FocusNet will be released soon.
